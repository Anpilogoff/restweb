Hello! This file contains project developing business logic description. It'll be update in each commit.

Application represents simplified social network contains components such as
    "online-chat",
    "private messages",
    "music"..and other components

To have deeper process understanding i decided to create REST application on JAVA EE "8" technology stack
    writing more logic-code and finding configuration troubleshooting solutions(from xml-based to annotation-based).

Deploying will be done by "Apache Tomcat " servlet container and in next steps it will transfered on glassfish web server.

Project dependencies will be described in "pom.xml" and deployment rules will be write in "web.xml" depl. descriptor

========================================================================================================================

STEP 1: Project structure and controller submodule creating...

    Project logic will implements MVC pattern. It will be contain 3 submodules:
        "controller" - requests/responses/sessions/listeners/context managing;

        "model" - contains dao layer logic;

        "view" duties will execute servlets by forwarding/redirecting,
            representations will be store in "webapp" directory,
            deployment descriptor will be store same path.
            Also, "webapp" diretory will be contain "resources" of formats "html, css, png, mp3..".

Before start i create "log4j.properties" in "src/main/resources" to configure logger.

First of all i begin to describe "controller" submodule to have standart client-server interaction. For example:
    -receiving clients request—ã by "FILTER CHAIN"(realize "CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY" pattern),
     checking it on specific parameters(attributes) by current web filter filling request/response object
     with new attributes and forward/redirect them to appropriate servlet or pass it to next filter chain element.
